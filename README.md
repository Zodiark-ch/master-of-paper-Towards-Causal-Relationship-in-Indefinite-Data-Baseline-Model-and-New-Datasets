# Our Papers
Pytorch code for Towards-Causal-Relationship-in-Indefinite-Data-Baseline-Model-and-New-Datasets

## New Datasets
Causalogue: 
A text dataset with 1638 dialogue samples, labeled with full causal relationships. 

Causaction: 
A video dataset with 1118 video samples, labeled with full causal relationships between two segments. 

These two new dataset would be open when our paper was accepted. 
Hope to see you soon!
